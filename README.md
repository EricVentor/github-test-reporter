It means a lot to us and helps us grow this open source library.

## Features

- Publish test results on Github Actions using your [CTRF](https://ctrf.io) report.

## Usage

You'll need a CTRF report generated by your testing framework. There are many [CTRF reporters](https://www.ctrf.io/docs/category/reporters) available.

For a test summary table, add the following to your workflow yaml:

``` yaml
- name: Publish Test Results
  run: npx github-actions-ctrf summary path/to/your/ctrf-report.json
```

For a test details table, add the following to your workflow yaml:

``` yaml
- name: Publish Test Results
  run: npx github-actions-ctrf tests path/to/your/ctrf-report.json
```

## What is CTRF?

CTRF is a universal JSON test report schema that addresses the lack of a standardized format for JSON test reports.

**Consistency Across Tools:** Different testing tools and frameworks often produce reports in varied formats. CTRF ensures a uniform structure, making it easier to understand and compare reports, regardless of the testing tool used.

**Language and Framework Agnostic:** It provides a universal reporting schema that works seamlessly with any programming language and testing framework.

**Facilitates Better Analysis:** With a standardized format, programatically analyzing test outcomes across multiple platforms becomes more straightforward.
